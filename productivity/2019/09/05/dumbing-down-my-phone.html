    <p>I’ve gotten really annoyed by my phone. Lately it seems like I’ve been pulling it out of my pocket for no reason other than to look at it. This doesn’t feel good.</p>

<p>In the past, I’ve tried to limit my attachment to my phone by removing apps that are time wasters (hi, reddit). This has mostly proved ineffective, since I tend to just use the browser to access the same time wasting content. I found that I’ve had trouble staying focused when there’s such an easy escape to procrastination by my side at all times. There’s better things to do with my time than to stare at a luminous brick, so I’ve made some changes to my phone.</p>

<p>Now, I do believe that there are some redeeming qualities of a cell phone. Those main qualities are: Communication (calls and text messaging), Calendaring, Notes, Navigation, and Payment. Outside of these things, I’ve decided that there isn’t much else my phone does that’s valuable enough to warrant having it available in my pocket at all times. I’ve deleted everything from my phone that’s related to accessing social feeds and news sites, as well as shopping apps. These types of activities are ones that I find the most distracting, and create the largest pull to opening my phone. In reality, very little of my life depends on being able to look at this stuff at any given moment – they’ve become activities that I do for the sake of doing them. So, they’re gone.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that I haven’t included email in the list of qualities that my phone should have. I’m currently privileged in that I don’t work for an employer that 1) treats email like a time critical communication medium, and 2) expects me to respond to email at times when I am not sitting in front of an actual computer. I will concede that not everyone has these luxuries, and that I am quite lucky. With these facts in mind, I realized that there are exactly zero cases where I need my email “on the go”. It’s another thing that just causes stress by existing and being easily accessible. Just having it on my phone makes it seem more urgent and important than it actually is. So, I’m going to try not using my phone for email at all, and will keep you updated on how this goes in the long term. Some instruction to friends and colleagues is required here, to inform them to use different means to contact me when something is urgent.</p>

<p>Once all the social feeds and things that I need to check for the sake of checking them are gone, the last major hurdle for me is the web browser. I do feel some slight utility in being able to google search things quickly while I’m out and about. To allow for this, I’ve configured my phone to allow me to use the browser for ten minutes a day. I’m hopeful that this will make the browser useful, while not allowing for it to be a tool that I use to fall down productivity rabbit holes…</p>

<p>The result that I’m left with now is that my phone is a tool that does useful things for me. I can communicate with other people, keep track of my schedule, and keep quick notes, and that’s all that I feel like my phone needs to do. This strikes me as the first time in years that my phone is a productive tool rather than an entertainment device. I’m looking forward to how this experiment goes, and will post an update when I feel like I can articulate some measurable changes.</p>
