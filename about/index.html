    <p><strong>Who… or what I am</strong></p>

<p>Professionally, I am currently a software developer working primarily on web applications. I first started programming when I was in high school, after discovering the ‘View Source’ feature in my web browser. My career path has taken me through desktop IT support, to site reliability engineering to now, where I program custom applications that make my coworker’s lives easier.</p>

<p>My career focus is in building reliable system architectures. The depth of my experience is in system administration, configuration management, and cloud application architecture design. I like working with filesystems and storage, as well as building monitoring and observability pipelines that make system administration enjoyable.</p>

<p>Personally, I enjoy being outdoors, watching various sports, mechanical watches, and making good coffee and food. I like bouldering, as it’s an activity that lets me solve problems in a completely different way than when I’m herding flocks of computers. My educational background is in psychology, and my interests there include team/group dynamics as well as examining the way that people interact with their tools of trade.</p>

<p><strong>The cardboard… box?</strong></p>

<p>When I decided to write this blog, I didn’t really have a particular topic in mind. This site is the digital cardboard box under my stairs. At any given time, I have lots of ideas floating around in my mind, and this site is intended to be a place to put those thoughts. Topics that you’ll likely see on this site will be a mix of technical articles related to some kind of software development, outdoors stuff related to my hiking and rock climbing adventures, and possibly some ruminating on how to run successful business and software development teams.</p>

<p>The site itself is built with Jekyll. I don’t love the static site generator workflow, but the resulting pile of HTML that jekyll spits out is easy to reason with, simple to deploy, and scales well. Bonus points for not having to worry about PHP.</p>
